## Overview

TotalRepeats is a universal, *de novo* tool for genome-wide identification, classification, annotation, visualization, and comparison of repetitive DNA elements. It efficiently detects a wide spectrum of repeats, including:

- **Mobile genetic elements** — transposons, retrotransposons (LINEs, SINEs, LTR elements, DNA transposons)
- **Tandem arrays** — microsatellites (SSRs), minisatellites, telomeric repeats, centromeric satellite DNA
- **Gene duplication** — duplicated genes, rearrangements, and copy-number variants
- **Large-scale structural variations** — segmental duplications, rearrangements
- **Unique sequence identification** — detection of sequences that occur only once across the entire genome and within individual chromosomes
 
The tool is particularly well-suited for comparative genomics, evolutionary biology, structural variation studies, and bioinformatics research. Masking, clustering, and annotation are fully **multithreaded**, scaling efficiently from personal laptops to HPC/supercomputing clusters.

## What's New

Latest additions to TotalRepeats:

- **Containment clustering for size-disparate homology (`-contain`).** The default clustering measure compares the whole-composition k-mer profile of two blocks, so a short element that is a copy of only *part* of a longer one is drowned out and left ungrouped. The new `-contain` mode instead groups a block with a seed when most of its k-mers *occur inside* that seed (an asymmetric containment index on canonical k-mers), so short elements are placed with the longer repeats that contain them, and reverse-complemented copies are found and labelled on the minus strand. See [`-contain`](#-contain--containment-clustering).
- **Comparative analyses are no longer capped at ~2 GB.** The `-collate`, `-joint`, and `-combinemask` modes previously failed with `OutOfMemoryError: Requested string length exceeds VM limit` once the *combined* length of all input sequences passed ~2.1 GB — Java's hard limit on the size of a single array/`String`. They now concatenate the inputs **virtually** and address them with **64-bit (long) coordinates**, so a joint analysis scales to pangenome-sized data (tens of Gb) without ever materializing a single oversized string. Each individual sequence/chromosome is still limited to 2 GB; the *total* across files is now effectively bounded only by available RAM.
- **Per-file reports in every comparative mode.** `-collate`, `-joint`, and `-combinemask` now each emit an individual GFF3 annotation, PNG, and SVG per input file (named after that file), *in addition to* the combined report. Each genome can be inspected on its own while the joint clustering is preserved — the same family keeps the same `ClusterID`, colour, row, and reference label in both the per-file and combined views.
- **Pangenome analysis — core / accessory / unique — across all comparative modes.** Every combine run now writes a pangenome report classifying each repeat family by how many sequences it occurs in: **core** (present in all), **accessory** (present in some), and **unique** (present in one). It includes the family-frequency spectrum, per-sequence statistics, a pairwise shared-family matrix (Jaccard similarity), and a machine-readable presence/absence matrix. See [`-collate`](#-collate--comparative-analysis).
- **Combined image is now SVG.** The joint (cross-file) visualization is written as scalable SVG, which has no pixel-size ceiling and stays sharp at pangenome scale. Per-file images are still produced as both PNG and SVG.
- **Multithreaded clustering is now the default.** Clustering runs across all CPU cores out of the box; pass `-normal` to force the single-threaded path instead. The multithreaded path is **deterministic and reproducible** — repeated runs on the same input produce identical cluster assignments and `ClusterID`s, independent of how many worker threads are used.
- **Performance improvements.** Faster low-complexity/SSR masking and sequence clustering — k-mer encoding and reduced memory traffic in the hot loops — with identical results.

1. **Input** — Reads one or more FASTA files (or an entire directory of genomes).
2. **Masking** — Decomposes sequences into k-mers, identifies over-represented k-mers, and masks repeated regions.
3. **Clustering** — Groups repeat copies into families by sequence similarity; classifies each family as tandem repeat, unclassified interspersed, or annotated (if a library is provided).
4. **Annotation** *(optional)* — Matches repeat clusters against Repbase, Dfam/FamDB, or a custom database to assign superfamily and class labels.
5. **Output** — Produces GFF3 annotations, soft-masked FASTA, publication-ready images, and summary statistics.

---

## Usage

### Basic Syntax

```bash
java [JVM flags] -jar TotalRepeats.jar <input_file_or_directory> [options] <output_directory>
```

- **Input** can be a single FASTA file or a directory containing multiple genomes.
- **Options** are space-separated and follow the input path.
- No additional dependencies are required.
- **Need help?** Run with `-help`, `--help`, `-h`, `-?`, `/?`, or `/h` (or with no arguments at all) to print the full usage guide and exit. The usage guide is also shown if the supplied input file or folder does not exist.

### Memory Configuration

When working with large genomes, allocate additional heap memory using JVM flags:

| Chromosome Size | Recommended RAM | JVM Flags |
|---|---|---|
| < 100 MB | Default | None needed |
| 100–500 MB | 16 GB | `-Xms8g -Xmx16g` |
| 500 MB – 2 GB | 32 GB | `-Xms16g -Xmx32g` |
| > 2 GB | 64+ GB | `-Xms32g -Xmx64g` |

**What the flags mean:**

- **`-Xms`** (initial heap) — Memory pre-allocated at startup. Avoids costly resizing during execution.
- **`-Xmx`** (maximum heap) — Upper memory limit. Prevents `OutOfMemoryError` for large genomes.

> **Tip:** Set `-Xms` to roughly one-quarter of `-Xmx` for a good balance between startup speed and memory efficiency.

> **Comparative runs (`-collate`, `-joint`, `-combinemask`):** size the heap to the *combined* length of all input files, not the largest single file. These modes now handle a combined size above 2 GB (they no longer build one giant string), so the only practical limit is the heap you provide — allocate accordingly for pangenome-scale inputs.

### Common Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `kmer=N` | K-mer size for repeat detection (range: 9–21) | `19` |
| `sln=N` | Minimum repeat block length (bp) | `80` |
| `image=WxH` | Output image dimensions (pixels) | Auto |
| `imgx=N` | Image width scaling factor (1 = compressed, 20 = stretched) | `5` |
| `flanks=N` | Extend each repeat by N bases on both sides | `0` |
| `-seqshow` | Include repeat sequences in GFF3 output | Off |
| `-maskonly` | Generate only the masked FASTA (skip clustering/annotation) | Off |
| `-normal` | Use single-threaded clustering (multithreaded is the default) | Off |
| `-contain` | Cluster by k-mer containment — groups size-disparate homologous blocks (a short element inside a long one) and reverse-complement copies; no effect in `-homology` | Off |
| `-help` | Show the usage guide and exit (aliases: `--help`, `-h`, `-?`, `/?`, `/h`) | — |

### Advanced Options

|---|---|
| `-collate` | Comparative analysis — synchronized repeat clustering across multiple files; per-file reports + combined report + pangenome (see [Comparing the comparative modes](#comparing-the-comparative-modes)) |
| `-joint` | Comparative analysis where all target sequences are treated as a single combined search space — repeat identification is performed over the whole set, then clustered jointly. Produces per-file reports and a pangenome report (see [Comparing the comparative modes](#comparing-the-comparative-modes)) |
| `-combinemask` | Comparative analysis with mask-based detection — synchronized clustering across files for masking-mode comparison and pangenome studies; per-file reports + combined report + pangenome (no per-file masked FASTA) |
| `-homology` | Mask all homologous regions to highlight unique sequences between genomes |
| `-amask` | Perform masking via pairwise sequence alignment (instead of k-mer-based) |

---

## Detailed Option Reference

### `kmer=` — K-mer Size

Sets the k-mer length for repeat masking (range: 9–21). Shorter k-mers detect shorter repeats but increase runtime and noise; longer k-mers are more specific but miss short elements.

| K-mer Range | Best For | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| 9–12 | Very short repeats | CRISPR spacers |
| 13–17 | Small chromosomes, organellar genomes | Mitochondria, plastids, bacteria |
| 18–21 | Eukaryotic chromosomes (recommended) | Human, plant, fungal genomes |

```bash
java -Xms16g -Xmx32g -jar TotalRepeats.jar genome.fasta kmer=21
```

### `sln=` — Minimum Repeat Block Length

Sets the minimum length (bp) for a repeat region to be included in the output. Shorter values capture small elements (e.g., Alu ~300 bp, tRNA-SINEs ~100 bp) at the cost of more fragmented results.

| Value | Effect |
|---|---|
| 20–60 | Captures very short repeats (CRISPR spacers, MITE elements) |
| 60–80 | Good balance for most analyses (default) |
| 100+ | Filters out short elements; focuses on longer repeats |

```bash
java -Xms16g -Xmx32g -jar TotalRepeats.jar genome.fasta sln=100
```

### Multithreaded Clustering

Clustering is **multithreaded by default** — no flag is required. The pairwise k-mer-vector comparison that dominates the clustering step is spread across all available CPU cores, giving a large speed-up on genomes with many repeat families.

The multithreaded clustering is **deterministic**: repeated runs on the same input produce identical cluster assignments and `ClusterID`s, and the result does not depend on the number of worker threads. Output is therefore fully reproducible — across repeated runs and across machines with different core counts — which matters for published analyses. The thread count affects only runtime, not the result.

```bash
# Multithreaded by default — no flag needed
java -Xms16g -Xmx32g -jar TotalRepeats.jar genome.fasta
```

**`-normal` — single-threaded clustering.** Pass `-normal` to run the clustering on a single thread instead of in parallel. This is slower on large genomes, but is useful for debugging or when you want the single-threaded code path.

```bash
java -Xms16g -Xmx32g -jar TotalRepeats.jar genome.fasta -normal
```

**Capping threads without `-normal`.** To keep multithreading but limit how many worker threads it uses — for example on a shared cluster node, or to leave cores free for other jobs — set the standard JVM property *before* `-jar`. This bounds Java's common Fork/Join pool, which the parallel clustering uses:

```bash
# Keep multithreading, but limit it to 8 worker threads
java -Djava.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.parallelism=8 -Xms16g -Xmx32g -jar \
    TotalRepeats.jar genome.fasta
```

Setting that value to `1` runs the parallel code path on a single thread; `-normal` instead selects a separate single-threaded code path. Both end up using one thread, so either works when you need to disable parallelism.

### `-contain` — Containment Clustering

By default, clustering groups repeat blocks by comparing their **whole k-mer composition** (a 4-mer ratio profile). That works well when the blocks are of comparable length, but it cannot see a short element that is a copy of only *part* of a longer block: the short block's composition is built from too few k-mers, so its homology to the long block goes unseen and it is left as an unclassified singleton.

`-contain` switches the clustering step to an **asymmetric k-mer containment** measure, ported from [GeneDistance](https://github.com/rkalendar/GeneDistance). A block is absorbed into a (longer) seed when a large share of its k-mers *occur inside* that seed:

```
C(A, B) = |kmers(A) ∩ kmers(B)| / |kmers(A)|   — how much of A occurs in B
```

Because the measure asks "how much of the short block is contained in the long one?" rather than "how similar are their overall compositions?", it groups a short element with the longer repeat that contains it — the case the default measure misses. The k-mers are **canonical**, so a copy inserted in the reverse-complement orientation is still found and is labelled on the minus strand (a negative length in the GFF/SVG, exactly as for the default measure).

**When to use it.** Reach for `-contain` when your repeats span a wide range of lengths — fragmented or truncated copies alongside full-length elements, or short sub-elements shared between larger repeats. It pairs naturally with the comparative modes:

```bash
# Pangenome run grouping size-disparate homologous repeats
java -Xms16g -Xmx32g -jar TotalRepeats.jar /path/to/genomes/ -joint -contain
```

**Notes.**
- The exact k-mer length is chosen automatically from the median block length (an odd value in 11–24); it is independent of the `kmer=` used for repeat *detection*.
- Deterministic and reproducible, like the default clustering, and unaffected by the worker-thread count.
- Uses more memory than the default path — roughly 16 bytes per distinct k-mer per block — so give the JVM enough heap (`-Xmx`) for large combined runs.
- `-homology` performs no clustering, so `-contain` has no effect in that mode.
- The output is unchanged in shape (the same `ClusterID`s, strands, colours, per-file/combined reports, and pangenome classification), so every downstream report works exactly as before.

### `-lib=` — External Repeat Library

Annotate detected repeat families against a curated database. TotalRepeats does **not** ship with libraries — download them separately:

| Source | URL | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Dfam / FamDB** | <https://www.dfam.org/releases/current/families/FamDB> | Open access; HMM-based profiles |
| **Repbase** | <https://www.girinst.org/> | Requires registration; curated consensus sequences |
| **Custom** | — | Build your own FASTA library for a species of interest |

```bash
java -Xms16g -Xmx32g -jar TotalRepeats.jar genome.fasta -lib=/path/to/library.ref
```

### Comparing the comparative modes

All three comparative modes cluster repeats *jointly* across the input files, and all three now produce per-file reports, a combined report, and a pangenome report. They differ mainly in how repeats are detected and in which per-file files are written:

| Mode | Repeat detection | Combined image | Per-file outputs | Pangenome | Typical use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `-collate` | k-mer masking **per sequence**, then joint clustering | SVG | GFF3 · PNG · SVG · masked FASTA | ✅ | Compare homologous chromosomes / assemblies |
| `-joint` | sequences treated as **one** combined search space for detection | SVG | GFF3 · PNG · SVG · masked FASTA | ✅ | Treat a set of sequences as a single search space |
| `-combinemask` | mask-based detection per sequence, then joint clustering | SVG | GFF3 · PNG · SVG | ✅ | Masking-mode comparison / pangenome studies |

> All three handle a *pangenome* input larger than 2 GB — see [What's New](#whats-new). The combined (cross-file) image is SVG in every mode; per-file images are PNG **and** SVG.

### `-collate` — Comparative Analysis

Performs synchronized repeat clustering across multiple sequences. All files in the input directory are processed together, enabling direct cross-genome comparison of repeat families.

**Ideal for:**
- Comparing homologous chromosomes across species or strains
- Detecting repeat polymorphisms without whole-genome alignment
- Analysing long-read assemblies (e.g., ONT, PacBio HiFi)

```bash
java -Xms16g -Xmx32g -jar TotalRepeats.jar /path/to/sequences/ -collate
```

**Output files produced by a `-collate` run:**

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `<file>.gff`, `<file>.png`, `<file>.svg` | Per-file annotation and images for each input sequence |
| `<file>.msk` | Per-file soft-masked FASTA |
| `<report>.gff`, `<report>.svg` | Combined annotation and image (SVG) across all sequences |
| `<report>_pangenome.txt` | Pangenome summary (see below) |
| `<report>_pangenome.tsv` | Repeat-family presence/absence matrix |

**Pangenome report.** Using the synchronized clustering, each repeat family (CRP cluster) is mapped back to the sequences it occurs in and classified as:

- **core** — present in *all* analyzed sequences (shared content);
- **accessory** (shell) — present in some but not all sequences;
- **unique** (cloud) — present in a single sequence (differing content).

`<report>_pangenome.txt` reports the core/accessory/unique breakdown, the family-frequency spectrum (number of families present in exactly *k* sequences), per-sequence statistics (CRP / UCRP / STR content), the genome-specific (unique) families, and a pairwise shared-family matrix with Jaccard similarity. `<report>_pangenome.tsv` is a machine-readable presence/absence matrix — one row per family, one column per sequence — suitable for downstream analysis and plotting. The `ClusterID` column matches the GFF3 `ClusterID`, so the reports cross-reference each other.

The pangenome report is generated automatically for any multi-sequence comparative run (`-collate`, `-joint`, or `-combinemask`).

### `-combinemask` — Pangenome Analysis

Performs pangenome-scale comparative analysis with mask-based detection. Enables synchronized clustering and annotation across assemblies, and supports comparing different masking strategies or parameters.

Like `-collate`, it now also writes an **individual GFF3 + PNG + SVG per input file**, a **combined GFF + SVG**, and a **pangenome report** (`_pangenome.txt` / `_pangenome.tsv`). It does not write per-file masked FASTA. See [Comparing the comparative modes](#comparing-the-comparative-modes).

```bash
java -Xms16g -Xmx32g -jar TotalRepeats.jar /path/to/sequences/ -combinemask
```

### `-homology` — Homology Masking

Masks all homologous regions (both within and between input sequences) to reveal **unique, non-shared sequence**. This inverts the usual repeat-finding question: instead of "what's repeated?", it answers "what's unique?"

**Use cases:**
- Identifying lineage-specific sequence between closely related genomes
- Comparing human chromosomes X and Y
- Discovering strain-specific insertions or deletions

```bash
java -Xms16g -Xmx32g -jar TotalRepeats.jar /path/to/sequences/ -homology
```

### `imgx=` — Image Width Scaling

Controls the horizontal resolution of output images (PNG and SVG). Higher values produce wider, more detailed images suitable for zooming into specific regions.

| Value | Effect |
|---|---|
| `1` | Maximum compression — overview of entire genome |
| `10` | Default — good for most chromosome-level views |
| `20–30` | Stretched — detailed inspection of individual regions |

```bash
java -Xms16g -Xmx32g -jar TotalRepeats.jar genome.fasta imgx=20
```

### `-readmask` — Import Existing Masks

Imports pre-computed masking files (e.g., from RepeatMasker or a previous TotalRepeats run) for clustering, annotation, and visualization without re-running the masking step.

```bash
java -Xms16g -Xmx32g -jar TotalRepeats.jar masked_genome.fasta -readmask
```

### `-readgff` — Import GFF for Visualization

Imports an existing GFF annotation file and generates visualizations directly, bypassing repeat detection.

```bash
java -Xms16g -jar TotalRepeats.jar annotation.gff -readgff
```

### `-extract` — Split Multi-Entry FASTA

Splits a multi-entry FASTA file into separate files (one per sequence record). Useful for preparing input when you need per-chromosome processing.

```bash
java -jar TotalRepeats.jar multi_entry.fasta -extract
```

### `-maskscomp` — Compare Masking Tools

Compares masked outputs from different software tools (e.g., TotalRepeats vs. RepeatMasker). Requires a **tab-delimited** control file listing sequence/mask pairs:

```bash
java -jar TotalRepeats.jar runfiles.txt -maskscomp
```

**Example `runfiles.txt`:**

```
NC_017844.1.fasta	NC_017844.1.fasta.msk
NC_017849.1.fasta	NC_017849.1.fasta.msk
NC_017850.1.fasta	NC_017850.1.fasta.msk
```

TotalRepeats accepts standard FASTA format or plain-text nucleotide sequences. Multi-entry FASTA files are supported. Each individual sequence (chromosome / record) may be up to 2 GB; in the comparative modes (`-collate`, `-joint`, `-combinemask`) the *pangenome* size across all files is not limited by that cap.

## Troubleshooting

### No input file (usage is printed instead of results)

If you launch TotalRepeats with no arguments, with an explicit help flag, or with a first argument that is not an existing file or folder, the program prints the usage guide and exits without analysing anything:

```bash
# Explicit help request — prints usage and exits
java -jar TotalRepeats.jar --help

# Missing input (options only) — prints usage
java -jar TotalRepeats.jar -kmer=18 -seqshow

# Wrong path — prints "input file or folder not found" + usage
java -jar TotalRepeats.jar /no/such/genome.fasta
```

Make sure the **input file or folder is the first argument**, before any options:

```bash
java -jar TotalRepeats.jar genome.fasta -kmer=18 -seqshow   # correct
```

The recognised help flags are `-help`, `--help`, `-h`, `-?`, `/?`, `/h`, and `/help` (case-insensitive).

### Java version errors

Ensure Java 25+ is installed and active:

```bash
java -version
```

If multiple Java versions are installed, set `JAVA_HOME` explicitly:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk-25
export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

### `OutOfMemoryError`

Increase heap allocation according to the [Memory Configuration](#memory-configuration) table:

```bash
java -Xms16g -Xmx64g -jar TotalRepeats.jar genome.fasta
```

> **Tip:** If your machine has limited RAM, try `-maskonly` to skip clustering — the masking step uses significantly less memory.

> **`Requested string length exceeds VM limit` in a comparative run:** this specific error came from the earlier comparative code (`-collate`/`-joint`/`-combinemask`) building a single string of the whole concatenation, which Java caps at ~2.1 GB. It is resolved — these modes now concatenate virtually and use 64-bit coordinates. If you still hit a plain `OutOfMemoryError` (heap), raise `-Xmx` per the table above.

### No repeats detected

- **Check k-mer size:** For small genomes or short repeats, reduce `kmer` (e.g., `kmer=12`).
- **Lower minimum length:** Reduce `sln` (e.g., `sln=30`) to capture shorter elements.
- **Verify input:** Ensure the FASTA file contains valid nucleotide sequence.

### Output images are too small or too compressed

Increase the image scaling factor:

```bash
java -jar TotalRepeats.jar genome.fasta imgx=30
```

Or specify exact dimensions:

```bash
java -jar TotalRepeats.jar genome.fasta image=4000x2000
```

### Slow clustering on large genomes

Clustering is multithreaded by default and already uses all available CPU cores — first make sure you have **not** passed `-normal`, which forces the slower single-threaded path:

```bash
# Multithreaded by default — do NOT add -normal
java -Xms16g -Xmx32g -jar TotalRepeats.jar genome.fasta
```

To cap the worker-thread count (e.g. on a shared node) while keeping multithreading, add `-Djava.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.parallelism=N` before `-jar`. Multithreaded clustering is deterministic, so the thread count changes only the runtime, not the output.

## FAQ

**Q: Does TotalRepeats require a pre-built repeat library?**
No. TotalRepeats performs *de novo* detection using k-mer analysis — no external library is needed. However, you can optionally provide a library (Repbase, Dfam, or custom) via `-lib=` to classify and annotate the detected repeat families.

**Q: What organisms does TotalRepeats support?**
Any organism with a DNA sequence. TotalRepeats is organism-agnostic and has been used on viral, bacterial, fungal, plant, and animal genomes.

**Q: How does TotalRepeats compare to RepeatMasker?**
RepeatMasker relies on a curated library (Repbase/Dfam) and performs homology-based detection — it can only find repeats represented in its database. TotalRepeats works *de novo*, detecting all repeated sequences regardless of prior annotation. The two tools are complementary: use TotalRepeats for comprehensive discovery and RepeatMasker for precise classification. The `-maskscomp` option lets you compare their outputs directly.

**Q: Can I process multiple genomes at once?**
Yes. Point TotalRepeats at a directory containing FASTA files, and it will process all of them. Add `-collate` (or `-joint` / `-combinemask`) for synchronized cross-genome repeat clustering — each of these produces a per-file report and image for every input, a combined report and image, and a pangenome report (core / accessory / unique families plus a presence/absence matrix). See [Comparing the comparative modes](#comparing-the-comparative-modes).

**Q: What is the maximum genome size TotalRepeats can handle?**
TotalRepeats has been tested on genomes exceeding 20 Gb (e.g., *Pleurodeles waltl*). A single sequence (one FASTA record) is capped at 2 GB by Java's array/`String` limit, but in the comparative modes the *combined* size across files is not — those modes concatenate virtually and use 64-bit coordinates. The practical limiting factor is available RAM, so allocate sufficient heap via `-Xms` / `-Xmx`.

**Q: My `-collate` run crashed with `Requested string length exceeds VM limit` — is that fixed?**
Yes. That error came from concatenating all inputs into one string, which Java caps at ~2.1 GB. The comparative modes (`-collate`, `-joint`, `-combinemask`) now build the concatenation virtually and address it with 64-bit coordinates, so the combined analysis runs at pangenome scale. Any remaining memory issue would be an ordinary heap `OutOfMemoryError` — raise `-Xmx`.

**Q: Can I import results from other tools?**
Yes. Use `-readmask` to import masked FASTA files from RepeatMasker or other tools, and `-readgff` to import GFF annotations for visualization.

**Q: What does the `-normal` flag do exactly?**
By default, clustering is multithreaded — the pairwise comparison step runs across all CPU cores, which greatly speeds up large genomes with many repeat families. Passing `-normal` turns that off and runs the clustering on a single thread: slower, but useful for debugging or when you want the single-threaded code path. If you want to keep multithreading but only limit the number of worker threads, add `-Djava.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.parallelism=N` before `-jar` instead (see [Multithreaded Clustering](#multithreaded-clustering)). The multithreaded path is deterministic: repeated runs produce identical cluster assignments and `ClusterID`s regardless of thread count.
